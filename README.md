# CSC130DSpring2018
I am a student at Elon Universty taking my first Computer Science course. 
I am part of the colligate program here at Elon so I am currently a senior in high school taking courses at Elon. I am committed for attending full time next year and will be in the graduating class of 2022! #bELONg 
This is a collection of all I have worked on this semester. 
Computer Science is nothing like I anticpated, it is challenging, infuriating, but in the end very rewarding. 
I am considering a minor in Comp Sci in addition to my Major of Strategic Communications. 
Please Enjoy my work! You can find some daily activities, labs and projects for Computer Science 130.
