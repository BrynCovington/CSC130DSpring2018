# CSC130DSpring2018
I am a student at Elon Universty taking my first Computer Science course. 
I am part of the colligate program here at Elon so I am currently a senior in high school taking courses at Elon. I am committed for attending full time next year and will be in the graduating class of 2022! #bELONg 
This is a collection of all I have worked on this semester. 
Computer Science is nothing like I anticpated, it is challenging, infuriating, but in the end very rewarding. 
I am considering a minor in Comp Sci in addition to my Major of Strategic Communications. 
Please Enjoy my work! You can find some daily activities, labs and projects for Computer Science 130. 
P.S. shout out to Ms. Day!!!
